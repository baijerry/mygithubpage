# My Personal Website

This is my personal website, and my first venture into web development. 

Learning from scratch, I took the "Make a Website" course on Codeacademy, watched a bunch of HTML development videos on YouTube, and read up on various Boostrap, CSS, and HTML documentation online. (Now I know what a <tag> is!)

Since I am hosting this website on Github Pages, I also took a few weeks to learn Git for the first time as well.

Updates:

Dec 20 - Mapped out website content (topics, number of pages, etc)

Dec 22 - Finished temporary landing page to test things out. Finished learning (enough of) Git, using it to push up changes from now on

Dec 25 - Looked up standard directory conventions, realized I was being a noob and created the js + css folder. Created all the HTML pages I need for the website. Read Boostrap navigation bar documentation, and created a responsive navigation bar to link pages together.
