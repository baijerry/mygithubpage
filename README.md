# My Personal Website

This is my personal website, and my first venture into web development. 

Learning from scratch (I didn't know what a < tag > was when I started), I took the "Make a Website" course on Codeacademy, watched a bunch of HTML development videos on YouTube, and read up on various Boostrap, CSS, and HTML documentation online.

This project's purpose is to introduce myself to basic website structures, trends (mobile-first, responsive design), and allow me to be literate in HTML/CSS.
