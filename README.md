# My Personal Website

This is my personal website, and my first venture into web development. 

Learning from scratch, I took the "Make a Website" course on Codeacademy, watched a bunch of HTML development videos on YouTube, and read up on various Boostrap, CSS, and HTML documentation online. (I literally didn't know what a < tag > was when I started)

Since I am hosting this website on Github Pages, I also took a few weeks to learn Git for the first time as well. Will be using it to push up new developments.

Dec 22 - Finished temporary landing page to test out some concepts (html, css, git).

Dec 25 - Looked up standard directory conventions, realized I was being a noob and created the js + css folder. Created all the HTML pages I need for the website. Read Boostrap navigation bar documentation, and created a responsive navigation bar to link pages together. 

Dec 29 - Redesigned html structure for all the content pages (added a footer, container for title and content, etc)

Dec 30 - Finished front page, added contact links. Will learn and code animation for the contact links another time
