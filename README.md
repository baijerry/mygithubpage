# My Personal Website

This is my personal website, and my first venture into web development. 

My goal was to make this website from scratch, without templates. Various bootstrap components were used including the nav-bar and side-bar.

This project's purpose is to introduce myself to basic website structures, trends (mobile-first, responsive design), and allow me to be literate in HTML/CSS.
