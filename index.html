			<h3>What will be on here?</h3>
			<p>A resume can only go so far. I would love to use this to paint a more vibrant picture of who I am.
			<p>I will also be using this website to elaborate on past projects I have completed, and provide updates on current projects I am working on. Oh and of course, there will be tons of pictures and stories. This is my first time venturing into web development. I will first be using Bootstrap to build many components, and will expand the website's functionality as I learn. That being said, a blog may also be in the works. (On a related topic, you can check out my favourite blog <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/">here</a>.) </p>
